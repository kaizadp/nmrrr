Description: A reproducible workflow for binning and visualizing NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra 
    from environmental samples. The nmrrr package is intended for post-processing of NMR data, 
    including importing, merging and, cleaning data from multiple files, 
    visualizing NMR spectra, performing binning/integrations for compound classes, 
    and relative abundance calculations. 
    This package can be easily inserted into existing analysis workflows by users 
    to help with analyzing and interpreting NMR data.
