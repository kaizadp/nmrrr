\description{
NMR grouping bins from Clemente et al. (2012), using DMSO-D6 as solvent.
(1) aliphatic polymethylene and methyl groups (0.6–1.3 ppm, “aliphatic1”);
(2) aliphatic methyl and methylene near O and N (1.3–2.9 ppm, “aliphatic2”);
(3) O-alkyl, mainly from carbohydrates and lignin (2.9–4.1 ppm);
(4) α-proton of peptides (4.1–4.8 ppm);
(5) aromatic and phenolic (6.2–7.8 ppm); and
(6) amide, from proteins (7.8–8.4 ppm).
}
\note{
The NMR spectrum can be split into several bins, based on
chemical shift (ppm). Binsets are specific to nuclei and solvents and
by definition are open on the left and closed on the right;
for example, a bin of (0,1) includes 1 but \emph{not} 0.
