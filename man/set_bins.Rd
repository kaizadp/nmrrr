\title{Choose a bin set to group and integrate the NMR peaks}
\usage{
set_bins(BINSET)
}
\arguments{
\item{BINSET}{Choose the binset you want.
Options include: "Clemente2012", "Lynch2019", "Hertkorn2013_MeOD", "Mitchell2018"}
}
\value{
A dataframe with columns describing the group name (sometimes
abbreviated), start and stop boundaries, and a longer, more complete
description of the group.
}
\description{
The NMR spectrum can be split into several bins, based on
chemical shift (ppm). Choose a binset to group the peaks.
Binsets are specific to nuclei and solvents.
